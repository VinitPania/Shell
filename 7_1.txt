Test Operation:
Bash has a test command various bracket and parenthesis operation n if/else construct 

7.1 Test Construct 

An if/ele statement checks whether a the exit status of the script is 0 or not (since 0 means the script is executed success)
and if so it execute one or more command 

There is a dedicated special character called "["left bracket it is a synonym for the test  and a builtin for efficiency reason 
Its command consider its arguments as a comparisons expression or file test or return an exit as a status code corresponding too  the  result of the comparisons(0 for true and 1 for false)

With newer version of bash ie 2.02 it introduced the extended version of the test command [[ ]] which performs comparisons in a similar pattern in which human programers do.
Note that [[ ]] --> is a keyword not a command.
Bash sees [[ $a -lt $b  ]]  as a single element which returns a exit command /status 

# The Exit status of arithmetic operation is not an error value
